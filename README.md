# Semicolon Killer 
### Small macro to prank you dev friends.
### This macro changes the default semicolon to the greek question mark which visually is not different from the regular semicolon.
#### You can change the active state of the macro by pressing 'ctrl+shift+.'.
#### I personally recommend building this project as an exe and putting it inside the startup folder ðŸ˜Š.
